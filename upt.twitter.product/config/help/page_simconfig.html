	<h2> Social Simulator - version 1.1</h2> Last updated : 12 January 2012 <br>
	
	This page contains advanced simulator settings. These values are the recommended settings for running SocialSim.
	Changes should only be made by user who fully understand them. <br>
	The <u>CPU Usage</u> box sets the processor usage treshold. A lower value will make the computer more responsive in other tasks, however the simulation will run at a slower pace. A higher value will speed-up the simulation, but the computer responsiveness will be lowered. <br>
	The concurrency level of the application is set through the <u>Threads/Timer</u> box. A multicore processor system will run faster if more threads are used. A sinlge processor system will run slower if more threads are used. The thread number is system specific and can be optimized through experimenting. <br>
	The <u>Min Sleep</u> and <u>Max Sleep</u> values define the fastest and slowest interaction rates of the social agents, expressed in simulation iterations. <br>
	The <u>Monitoring</u> value sets the real time rate (milliseconds) at which the society is polled for opinion. A slower rate will increase the simulation speed but provide less data. A faster rate will provde more real time data but at the cost of processor time. A value smaller than 250 is not recommended. <br>
	The simulation <u>Duration</u> defines the number of iterations the simulation will run.
